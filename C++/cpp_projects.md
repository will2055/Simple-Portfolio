## C/C++ Projects

The projects in this folder are C & C++ files I've worked on. I'm the most comfortable with this language. I find it easier to explore hardware level concepts. I still have a lot to learn! But below are some projects I've worked on. 

Feel free to let me know what I could do bettter, thanks!
