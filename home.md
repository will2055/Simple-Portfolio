This github repo is my current portfolio. I'm currently and equipment operator at Sparkfun Electronics. Oh! And I love being a **Geek**!

I enjoy Arduino and Raspberry Pi in large part. I still find time for other interests as well. Below are a list of projects I've been a part of or developed on my own. If you see a project and want more information, wish to contribute to, or just want to let me know you like it then feel free to shoot me an email!

* [Python](https://github.com/will2055/Simple-Portfolio/blob/master/python/python_projects.md)
* [C/C++](https://github.com/will2055/Simple-Portfolio/blob/master/C%2B%2B/cpp_projects.md)
* [Hardware](https://github.com/will2055/Simple-Portfolio/blob/master/Board%20Designs/hardware.md)

I have so much more I want to do! Stay tuned for more projects!
